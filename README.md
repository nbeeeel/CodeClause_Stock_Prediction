The notebook for Time Series Prediction and Exploratory Data Analysis of Stock Prices for six banks

##Time Series Analysis
    Time Series Analysis is executed for problems of regression nature. Those problems that employ a continuous changing trend and are time dependant. For such problems we use Time Series Analysis by using statical analysis techniques and methods. Moreover, certain deep learning and machine learning techniques are used to generate models and inferences. These models can help with weather prediction, temperature changes, stock prices and quantity that is time dependant.
    
     Here we use LSTM networks belonging to the Recurrent Neural Network class of deep learning to predict the closing rates of a stock.
